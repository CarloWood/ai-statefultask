/*!
 * @brief A ring buffer for moveable objects.
 *
 * Usage (using for example <code>std::function&lt;void()&gt;</code>):
 *
 * @code
 * constexpr int capacity = 8;
 * AIObjectQueue<std::function<void()>> queue(capacity);    // Allocates 9 std::function<void()> objects.
 * @endcode
 *
 * The actual size of the allocated memory for this
 * queue will be nine: eight objects can be written
 * to the queue without reading anything from it.
 * The space for the nineth object is reserved to
 * store the last object that was already read from
 * the queue but wasn't popped yet.
 */
//! @code
//! // Producer threads:
//! { // Lock the queue for other producer threads.
//!   auto access = queue.producer_access();
//!   int length = access.length();
//!   if (length == capacity) { /* Buffer full */ return; }
//!   access.move_in([](){ std::cout << "Hello\n"; });
//! } // Unlock the queue.
//! @endcode
/*!
 * The value of \c length allows one to do client-side
 * bandwidth control; by reducing the throughput till
 * the returned length is as small as possible one can
 * reduce the latency.
 *
 * Note that due to race conditions, the actual length
 * might be less, as consumer threads can read from the
 * queue while we hold the producer lock.
 */
//! @code
//! // Consumer threads:
//! std::function<void()> f;
//! { // Lock the queue for other consumer threads.
//!   auto access = queue.consumer_access();
//!   int length = access.length();
//!   if (length == 0) { /* Buffer empty */ return; }
//!   f = access.move_out();
//! } // Unlock the queue.
//! f(); // Invoke the functor.
//! @endcode
/*!
 * Here the actual length might be greater than the
 * returned value because producer threads can still
 * write to the queue while we hold the consumer lock.
 * In fact, both calls to \c length() do essentially the same
 * calculation (which doesn't require locking at all to be
 * thread-safe); the only difference is the memory model
 * used for access, but the locking by accessing \c length()
 * through the respective access objects is necessary to
 * prevent a producer thread having a race condition with
 * another producer thread, or a consumer thread having a
 * race condition with another consumer thread.
 *
 * <h3>const qualifier and %AIObjectQueue&lt;T&gt;</h3>
 *
 * Essentially, an %AIObjectQueue only allows one to move
 * objects of type \c T into and out of the queue;
 * it doesn't have accessors.
 * Consequently none of its member functions is const.
 *
 * Therefore, it is possible to overload the use of the const
 * qualifier for the public member functions to mean: these
 * member functions are threadsafe; they may be accessed
 * concurrently by multiple threads.
 *
 * Specifically, producer_access() and consumer_access(),
 * although \c const, <em>do</em> allow respectively writing data into \htmlonly&dash;\endhtmlonly
 * and extracting data from the queue. Their const-ness merely means that concurrent
 * access is thread safe.
