/*!
 * @brief The thread pool class.
 *
 * Only one AIThreadPool may exist at a time; and can subsequently be
 * accessed by a call to the static function AIThreadPool::instance().
 *
 * However, an AIThreadPool is not a singleton: it doesn't have
 * private constructors and it may not be constructed before main().
 * Also, it has a public move constructor (although only the thread
 * that created it may move it).
 * It is allowed to create an AIThreadPool and after some usage
 * destruct it; and then create a new one (this is not recommended).
 *
 * The <em>recommended</em> usage is:
 *
 * @code
 * int main()
 * {
 *   Debug(NAMESPACE_DEBUG::init());
 *
 *   AIThreadPool thread_pool;
 *   AIQueueHandle handler = thread_pool.new_queue(capacity);
 * ...
 *   // Use thread_pool or AIThreadPool::instance()
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * In order to <em>use</em> the thread pool one has to create one
 * or more task queues by calling AIThreadPool::new_queue. The
 * handle returned by that function can subsequently be used
 * to access the underlaying queue and move a <code>std::function<bool()></code>
 * object into it.
 *
 * For example,
 *
 * @code
 * ... (see above)
 *   // Create a new queue with a capacity of 32 and default priority.
 *   AIQueueHandle queue_handle = thread_pool.new_queue(32);
 * 
 *   {
 *     // Get read access to AIThreadPool::m_queues.
 *     auto queues_access = thread_pool.queues_read_access();
 *     // Get a reference to one of the queues in m_queues.
 *     auto& queue = thread_pool.get_queue(queues_access, queue_handle);
 *     bool queue_full;
 *     {
 *       // Get producer accesses to this queue.
 *       auto queue_access = queue.producer_access();
 *       int length = queue_access.length();
 *       queue_full = length == queue.capacity();
 *       if (!queue_full)
 *       {
 *         // Place a lambda in the queue.
 *         queue_access.move_in([](){ std::cout << "Hello pool!\n"; return false; });
 *       }
 *     } // Release producer accesses, so another thread can write to this queue again.
 *     // This function must be called every time move_in was called
 *     // on a queue that was returned by thread_pool.get_queue.
 *     if (!queue_full) // Was move_in called?
 *       queue.notify_one();
 *   } // Release read access to AIThreadPool::m_queues so another thread can use AIThreadPool::new_queue again.
 * @endcode
 *
 * It is necessary to keep <code>AIThreadPool::m_queues</code> read locked \htmlonly&mdash;\endhtmlonly
 * by not destroying the object returned by \ref queues_read_access \htmlonly&mdash;\endhtmlonly
 * for as long as the write lock on the queue exists.
 * I.e., in the above code, the lifetime of <code>queues_access</code>
 * must exceed the lifetime of <code>queue_access</code>.
 *
 * This is necessary because as soon as that read lock is released
 * some other thread can call AIThreadPool::new_queue causing a
 * resize of <code>AIThreadPool::m_queues</code>, the underlaying vector of
 * <code>AIObjectQueue<std::function<bool()>></code> objects,
 * possibly moving the AIObjectQueue objects in memory, invalidating the
 * returned reference to the queue.
 *
